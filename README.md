## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to retrieve and analize data for two months of the year within a SQLlite and SQLalchemy basis. This analysis was made with the purpose to provide the weather data for W.Avy in order to pitch the opening of a new store in Hawaii.

## Results

The first part of this analysis required a query extracting temperature observations for the month of June.

## Summary 

To sumarize, this data that was requested can definitely help the board to understand the weather conditions of months that could expect a high amount of visitors. My personal recommedation would be to also add a query for the same months with precipitaion data since rain can also affect businesses regardless of the temperature. 

For this, the following two queries would apply: 

Precipitations for June

Precipitations for December
